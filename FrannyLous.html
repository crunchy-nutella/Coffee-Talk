And I usually do oat milk at this point in my life. I like the taste of oat milk. I’m annoyed at alternative milks having oil in them. So I make my own if I can, but it doesn’t steam well.

	<div class="theArticle">
		<p>Blew Kind is the proud co-owner of Franny Lou’s Porch, a coffee shop located in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. At the heart of Kind and her shop is a love for human connection.</p>
		<p>Kind has worked in coffee houses since she was 14 years old, so she was familiar with their culture and operation when opening Franny Lou’s Porch in 2015. Before the shop gained traction, to make ends meet, Kind worked in the corporate world and waitressed at large chain restaurants. She knew these factory-like businesses were not the place for her. She then moved to a small, family-owned restaurant and felt at home in the culture that fostered interpersonal connection. Now, with her own shop, especially because “there’s less places for us to literally talk to each other, I’m still trying to incorporate that within our culture as much as I can.”</p>
		<p>Kind’s background in theater has given her insight into how to connect with other people. When she was 12 or 13 years old, she recited a monolog to her mother. “It was the first monolog that I ever memorized, it was one that I wrote. And then she told me, ‘Honeybun, this is what you’re supposed to be doing.’” Kind then went to high school and college for performing arts. While she is not performing on stage anymore, the experience has stayed with her. She said to be a convincing actor, “After you memorize things and after you do your research, you really walk on stage and let that all go. And you’re really just moment by moment.” Theater taught her how to be authentic and present, she explains, which now allows her to connect with each customer that walks through the door. One loyal customer, known as “the mayor of the town,” has been welcomed into the Kind family; “I have a picture of him holding my now ten-year-old as a little baby.”</p>
		<p>Kind also helps the customers to connect with each other. She once overheard a customer, a business owner, in need of a graphic designer and a graphic designer in need of work. Kind put them in touch “like a matchmaker,” she says; “they worked for two years together… That’s the kind of stuff I really like and I think it’s really beautiful when things happen.”</p>
		<p>For more structured ways to bring the community together, Franny Lou’s Porch holds many events; she wants to create a space where “people can come in and literally be welcome at any point in their life. Whether you’re a child or an elder, whether you’re black, brown, or queer.” For families with young children, every Thursday Franny Lou’s Porch hosts either Story Hour or Crafts and Play, to bring together children and parents. Then, Franny Lou‘s Porch becomes The Open Porch two Sundays a month – the pop-up gallery and open mic gather local artists, performers, and their fans. Franny Lou’s also hosts tea hours, virtual and in person. For some tea hours, tea-drinkers simply come together to enjoy the sunset; other times, there is a focus, such as bringing together Black business owners to talk about their experiences. These consistent events and many more make Franny Lou’s a place for everyone.</p>
		<p>In order to truly be inclusive, Franny Lou’s Porch prompts discussion about various issues. In their monthly newsletter, Kind attaches a pole question, a quote, and a “Love Note from Blew.” December’s “Love Note” encouraged readers to consider how they will create their legacy. They also prompt discussion with the names of their menu items. If you are in the mood for a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, you would ask for “The Anti-Capitalist.” Of course, some customers push back on the shop’s philosophies. Kind appreciates these customers: “I welcome it,” she says. “Having an emotional response to anything reminds us that we’re human. And that you have values and that you have thoughts and that you have something to offer. So if somebody is offended, that produces space for us to be like, ‘Let’s talk about this.”</p>
		<p>Creating a safe space for people to meet, reflect, and talk, Franny Lou’s has surely had a positive impact on the community. But, as Kind said, it could only have done so with the help of the customers who have subscribed to the shop’s culture. When asked what makes for a successful business, she concluded it was “having people around you that know more than you, so that you can ask for advice.” In practice, Franny Lou’s has a board of customers who represent the community and help with decision-making. While “they don’t get nothing but a discounted drink” for being on the board, Kind says, they are more than willing to share their advice and experiences. Franny Lou’s also has some other customers who help out more informally. “There’s Jacelyn who does all of our gardening now. Mama Gail, she takes care of all of our plants inside, because I can’t do that. She gets free coffee beans every week. We do a lot of bartering with community members. My friend Joshua does all of our murals.” Because these customers have grown to love Franny Lou’s, they offer their expertise to keep it running with little tangible return.</p>
		<p>With her loyal customers at their side, what is next for Franny Lou’s Porch? While opening a new storefront is not at the forefront of her goals, Kind does want to expand. Right now, she is focusing on catering and wholesale of their products. As she moves into these industries, Kind doesn’t want to lose sight of her values. It is no surprise that the question at the front of Kind’s mind is “how to build human connection even if it’s just a product?”</p>
