			<h3 class="coffee-question col-sm-5">"How do you take your coffee?"</h3>
			<p class="coffee-response col-sm-7">"If I can take my time with it every day, I like filter coffee. I like the sort of meditative approach to putting together filter coffee slowly. It’s like the low-fi version of coffee, so I enjoy that. And almost any different way, but the most common way I drink it is with a Chemex. Chemex is a glass carafe with a wooden collar in the middle. It uses a very simple paper filter. You put coarse ground coffee into the filter and then water at a temperature of 190&#176F and it takes about six minutes or so and you have your coffee. But it’s slow. You know, you’re standing over it and it’s the sounds, the smells, I think it’s the best way."<br>

			<p>The Green Engine is located in Haverford, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. From the decor to the customer and employee experience, Morris wants to create a space that feels authentic and welcoming: "It’s a more casual approach, a more wide-open-door policy.”</p>
			<p>Even the building itself holds a special place for Morris. Having grown up in a similarly old building in a Philadelphia suburb, Morris feels at home in the shop. The decor of the shop allows customers to have a similarly welcoming experience. One highlight is the green wall to the right as you walk through the door. “Plants make people happy,” Morris says. Running on a drip irrigation system, the living wall is a relatively inexpensive, low-maintenance way to bring life to the shop. This, too, is connected to Morris’s past. Before opening Green Engine, Morris owned a stormwater management company, so he applied his skills to design and build the wall himself.</p>
			<p>In addition to the previous experience from running a small business, studying anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania helped him tailor the shop to the customer: “I think on the surface level, anthropology is studying people, and I think it’s directly applicable to marketing. A consumer approach to business.” Morris and his business partner, Kelsey Bush, realized that to run a successful business it had to be a place people would want to come back to. Rather than focusing on winning the James Beard award for the best place to eat and drink on the planet, they simply wanted to be “a neighborhood spot, something that people return to multiple times,” Morris says.</p>
			<p>In order to have a sustainable business that people may return to, Morris said, “You have to sustain the people pushing the business forward – its employees.” On paper, that includes a higher starting wage than similar nearby businesses and more benefits than are required by law. But beyond that, Morris looks to create a healthy environment down to the way he refers to the people he hires: “I try to stay away from phrases like ‘my employees, my workforce.’ It’s not mine, it’s not an ownership. It’s my coworkers, my colleagues, if anything.” Morris says his style as an employer has been highly successful. The nature of the small business does not have a way for employees to rise in the ranks, so the main reason employees leave is to simply pursue other careers.</p>
			<p>The healthy work environment makes for a positive customer experience. Morris’s authenticity shows through, so it makes sense when he says, “I have friends from opening this business because people came to patronize us.” The Green Engine also has the coffee shop equivalent of barflies; many regulars will come by for a coffee or food and spend a few hours doing work, reading a book, or just hanging out. “I think it’s really lovely that people want to just come shoot the breeze out in public. It’s such a human thing to do,” Morris says.</p>
			<p>While Morris shapes the shop based on his experiences and the customers’ desires, he also must make decisions in the name of finances. He credits the executive management to Bush, his business partner; while he is “the ideas person,” Bush handles the “microfinancial, day-to-day” parts of running the business. When they first opened, the Green Engine team envisioned a shop that strictly sold coffee. However, when they thought about expanding the shop, this shifted. They wanted to increase the check average rather than the number of customers: “It’s hard to manage the more people you have. It just becomes chaos and it’s a less tailored experience,” Morris said. They brought in pastries, salad, sandwiches, and more to grow the individual customer’s spending. Another way Morris and Bush have been financially wise is by linking their second restaurant, Bloomsday, which offers brunch and dinner food as well as alcohol. When a customer approaches them about catering, they can offer the products from each shop, keeping the customer’s spending in house.</p>
			<p>With their success in finances, Morris makes sure to give back in a personal, meaningful way. They have selected two causes they have a connection to: cancer research and public education. While they are willing to support other causes if a customer approaches them, they find that choosing two focuses is an effective way to stay organized and make a consistent difference.</p>
			<p>When Morris is able to step away from the shop and spend time with his wife and two kids, he loves to play sports and travel. He jokes with his wife that “when we come home from a vacation, we’re planning the next one right away.” They often go to the Mediterranean, because he used to go when he was young. After graduating from high school, Morris lived in Spain with a host who introduced him to vermouth, a type of fortified wine. Now, he and a friend create their own vermouth that they have just started officially selling.</p>
			<p>People who are attracted to the decor, management, and quality products of Morris and Bush will be excited to hear about their third concept shop: a vermouthery. “If I had unlimited capital, I’d probably just keep doing little niche concepts that are interesting to me,” Morris says. To help him follow his dream and to enjoy a new restaurant, customers should look out for the opening of the third Morris-Bush establishment.</p>
