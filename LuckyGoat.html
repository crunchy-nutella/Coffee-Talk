		<p>The Lucky Goat Coffee House is located in Brewerytown. The owner, Toyin Ajayi-Frankel, combined her love of coffee with her love of African arts. Ajayi-Frankel was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. She moved to Seattle with her now husband and business partner after graduating from college. In Seattle, the couple started a non-profit organization together which combined their ties to Africa with their shared passion for the arts: the non-profit brought African culture – musicians, performers, and visual artists – to perform. While Ajayi-Frankel introduced Seattle to African arts, Seattle introduced her to coffee. “In Nigeria, it is mostly tea,” Ajayi-Frankel explains. “Coffee is just not in people’s consciousness.”</p>
		<p>Starbucks, which started in Seattle, opened their first shop while Ajayi-Frankel was living nearby. Ajayi-Frankel loved Starbucks’s mission: “It’s a culture of creating spaces for the community to come together and bring arts, a sense of drama and creativity into that space. And also making it kind of a community gathering place. You don’t have to know anybody. You don’t have to have lots of money.” When Ajayi-Frankel moved with her family to Philadelphia, her husband’s hometown, Philadelphia, and her youngest child went off to college, she decided she wanted to open her own shop: “Ok, now this is the time to do it,” she recounts.</p>
		<p>When you see the Lucky Goat Coffee House, you see Ajayi-Frankel: her African identity, her love of coffee and the arts, but at the forefront, her love for the community. When the shop first opened, customers came for all sorts of reasons. When the shop first opened in 2013, there were not a lot of places to walk to nearby. For many customers, it was a fun destination. Others come to the Goat, as Ajayi-Frankel calls it, because they want to support the owners: “Some people walk into here because they heard it’s owned by a Black, African woman and they want to come and see. Some people come because they know my husband is Jewish. I have a group of Jewish women who come in, they don’t even drink coffee, but they come in anyway, because they’re like ‘You’re one of us.’” For others, it is solely for the great tasting coffee, danishes, and bagels, all sourced from local businesses. Ajayi-Frankel says, “Everybody came in for different reasons, and slowly the community started creating itself.”</p>
		<p>The Goat became a prominent location in Fairmount. When real-estate agents were advertising a house nearby, they would say “It’s two blocks from Lucky Goat, it’s five blocks from Lucky Goat,” Ajayi-Frankel recounts. Not long after, agents in neighboring towns would advertise The Goat: “home for sale in Brewerytown, ten blocks from Lucky Goat!” The agents would bring their clients to sit down with a cup of coffee and sign agreements.</p>
		<p>The locals absolutely love the shop. I asked two customers, over their oat mocha and almond milk latte if they come often. “Oh, yeah, all the time,” the latte-drinker replied. “It’s our neighborhood coffee shop.” Ajayi-Frankel couldn’t help but smile when thinking about the regular customers. She remembers people who came in as babies now coming in by themselves to order a drink. She has seen first dates that resulted in marriage. “[The Lucky Goat] has become part of their life in a positive way.”</p>
		<p>For Ajayi-Frankel, bringing the community together is not only about the customers: “I see employees as part of the community.” She encourages them to share their own identities in the shop. As many are musicians or artists, they sometimes attend each other’s performances. She says that the best thing she can do to promote the inter-employee bond is “just let them be friends and be supportive of each other.” She also makes sure to hire employees with a similar desire to connect with the community. From the start she tells them, “Customers are going to want to know you. You can control how much, but they will expect that from you, based on who we are.” Finally, Ajayi-Frankel allows her employees to use their creativity to shape the menu. The Lucky Goat signature drink itself was created by the first barista.</p>
		<p>Ajayi-Frankel believes the community extends even further than employees and customers. “I say community in a global sense.”This is why the Goat makes sure to make environmentally aware decisions. They have recently switched from plastic cups to paper cups, regardless of the temperature of the beverage. With the polarized political climate, “We obviously cannot be open about politics because we don’t know who’s coming in or out, but I find a way to still be able to talk about things that politics should not be a part of, like the environmental issue.”</p>
		<p>Ajayi-Frankel connects the local community to the rest of the world by introducing her African culture. She has artwork hanging in the shop, whether from Nigeria or other countries, to expose customers and possibly start conversations. Like with her nonprofit in Seattle, she works with Johnny Brendas and the Abington Arts Center to bring African musicians and performers to the area. Each summer, Ajayi-Frankel hosts five free performances at the Abington Arts Center to make them truly accessible to everyone.</p>
		<p>Ajayi-Frankel has been considering recently what the future of the shop will look like. When asked what makes for a successful business, Ajayi-Frankel said, “We feel like if the product is good, the community feels welcome, the baristas are amazing, everything is good.” She keeps that in mind as she considers opening another shop; she might do so “if we feel like we can carry on that ideology or belief in terms of that community. Otherwise, I wouldn't want to just open another coffee shop. That’s not why we’re here.”</p>
